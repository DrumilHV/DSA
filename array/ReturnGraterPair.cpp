/*
Given two arrays X and Y of positive integers,
find the number of pairs such that xy > yx (raised to power of) 
where x is an element from X and y is an element from Y.

Input: 
M = 3, X[] = [2 1 6]

Output: 3
Explanation: 
The pairs which follow xy > yx are 
as such: 21 > 12,  25 > 52 and 61 > 16 .

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function countPairs()
 that takes X, Y, M, N as parameters and returns the total number of pairs.

Expected Time Complexity: O((N + M)log(N)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

=========================================>
Efficient Solution: 

The problem can be solved in O(nLogn + mLogn) time. 
The trick here is if y > x then x^y > y^x with some exceptions. 

Following are simple steps based on this trick. 

Sort array Y[].
For every x in X[], find the index idx of the smallest number greater than x 
(also called ceil of x) in Y[] using binary search, 
or we can use the inbuilt function upper_bound() in algorithm library.
All the numbers after idx satisfy the relation so just add (n-idx) to the count.
Base Cases and Exceptions: 

Following are exceptions for x from X[] and y from Y[]   

If x = 0, then the count of pairs for this x is 0.
If x = 1, then the count of pairs for this x is equal to count of 0s in Y[].
If x>1, then we also need to add count of 0s and count of 1s to the answer.
x smaller than y means x^y is greater than y^x.
x = 2, y = 3 or 4
x = 3, y = 2
Note that the case where x = 4 and y = 2 is not there

Following diagram shows all exceptions in tabular form. 
The value 1 indicates that the corresponding (x, y) form a valid pair.

exception table

In the following implementation, 
we pre-process the Y array and count 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 in it, 
so that we can handle all exceptions in constant time. 
The array NoOfY[] is used to store the counts.
